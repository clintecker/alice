## DESCRIPTION

Alice is an IRC client that can be run either locally or remotely, and
can be viewed in any WebKit browser. The alice server
maintains a message buffer, so when a browser connects it is sent
the 100 most recent lines from each channel. This allows the user to
close their browser while alice continues to aggregate messages.

Alice's built in web server maintains a long streaming HTTP connection
to each browser, and uses this connection to instantly push messages
to the browsers. Sending messages or commands is done through an HTTP
request back to alice's HTTP server.

Alice also logs messages to an SQLite database. These logs are searchable
by selecting Logs from the gear menu in the bottom corner.

## USAGE

After installing, there will be a new `alice' command available. Run
this command to start the alice server. Open your browser (Safari, Chrome, or
Fluid) and connect to the URL that was printed to your terminal
(likely http://localhost:8080/view). You will see a small gear icon in the
bottom corner; this button will bring up the connection configuration
menu. Add one or more IRC servers and channels in this window and save.
Alice will then connect to those servers, and the channels will appear as
tabs at the bottom of the screen.

## COMMANDS

### /j[oin] [-network] $channel

Takes a channel name as an argument. It will attempt to join this channel
on the server of the channel that you typed the command into.

### /part

This will close the currently focused tab and part the channel. Only works on
channels.

### /close

Closes the current tab, even private message tabs. If used in a channel
it will also part the channel.

### /clear

This will clear the current tab's messages from your browser. It will also 
clear the tab's message buffer so when you refresh your browser the messages 
won't re-appear (as they normally would.)

### /msg [-network] $nick [$msg]

Takes a nick as an argument. This will open a new tab for private messaging
with a user. Only works in a channel.

### /whois $nick

Takes a nick as an argument. This will print some information about the
supplied user.

### /quote $string

### /raw $string

Sends a string as a raw message to the server.

### /topic [$topic]

Takes an optional topic string. This will display the topic for the current tab.
If a string is supplied, it will attempt to update the channel's topic.
Only works in a channel.

### /n[ames]

This will print all of the nick's in the current tab in a tabular format.

### /me $string

Sends a string as an ACTION to the channel

## NOTIFICATIONS

If you get a message with your nick in the body, while no browsers are
connected, a notification will be sent to either Growl (if running on
OS X) or using libnotify (on Linux.) Alice does not send any notifications
if a browser is connected (the exception being Fluid SSB which will
Growl if unfocused). This is something that will probably become 
configurable over time.

## MOBILE INTERFACE

Surprisingly, alice is close to fulling working in Mobile Safari (the browser used
by the iPhone.) It still needs a little work to be fully functional, though (see KNOWN ISSUES.)

## KNOWN ISSUES

* Message area doesn't scroll on Firefox or Mobile Safari
